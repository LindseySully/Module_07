# Module_07 Final Project
## Sentiment Analysis of r/NoNewNormal Reddit Posts

### Project Overview
The following code evaluates a CSV file from r/NoNewNormal Reddit threads. It looks at the content of the posts and analyzes the sentiment analysis of the Title of the post vs. the content. The reason being is that this is an overwhelmingly negative reddit thread, but I wanted to see if the title is what makes the reddit thread appear negative or if the content of the post. 

### Python Libraries Utilized
